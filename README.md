# Christmas Gift

A Python program that reveals it's cli gift on December 24th or 25th  
(depending on how you configure it.  

This was made as a home made gift to my friends.  

How it works is it that you say what it will say when it isn't christmas yet,  
and you tell it what to say when it is christmas,  
and it will make a python script with the given messages obscured  
so the gift is relatively hidden until christmas.
